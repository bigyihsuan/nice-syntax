# nice-syntax

## Goals

* Create a language with "nice" syntax (in my eyes and brain)
* Use as few non-alphabetic symbols as possible
* Learn and use ANTLR to generate the lexer and parser.

### Desired Language Features

* Expression-based
* First-class functions
* Pattern matching
* Rust-like enums
